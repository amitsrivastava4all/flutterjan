A professor went to a party. Being an erudite person, he classified the party into two categories. He proposed that if all the persons in the party are wearing different colored robes, then that is a girl’s only party. If we even get one duplicate color, it must be a boy’s party. The colors of the robes are represented by positive integers.
Input The first line of each test case contains an integer T, denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of people in the party. In the next line are N space separated values of Ai denoting the color of the robes.
Output For each test case, print “BOYS” without quotes if it’s a boy’s party, else print “GIRLS”


i/p: 1 2 3 4 7
o/p: girls

i/p: 1 3 2 4 5 1
